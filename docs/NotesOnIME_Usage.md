# Notes on IME (Input Method Editor) Usage
- This **Hiragana Keyboard** can only type **Hiragana** and **Katakana**.
- Itâ€™s **not** a full-fledged IME (Input Method Editor).


### **Common IME Issues and Tips**

Many users face issues such as:
- Unwanted automatic conversion to Kanji or other characters.
- Difficulty keeping text in just Hiragana.
- Not knowing how to select the desired conversion.

These problems often occur because the IME shows an underline indicator when a word is in input mode, but this is easy to miss. Here are some tips to help you use the IME properly:

- **Type in Hiragana**, then press **Space** (or **Shift + Space**) to choose from suggested Kanji or other conversions.
- Press **Enter** to confirm your input and avoid further conversion.
- Use **Shift + Caps Lock** to switch to Hiragana input mode.
- Use **Alt + Caps Lock** to switch to Katakana input mode.
